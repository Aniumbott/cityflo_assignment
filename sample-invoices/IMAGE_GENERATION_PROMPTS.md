## 🎯 Testing Scenarios by Difficulty

| Difficulty | Prompts | Expected AI Behavior |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Easy** | #1, #6, #8 | Should extract most fields correctly |
| **Medium** | #2, #3, #4, #5, #10 | May miss some fields, low confidence |
| **Hard** | #7, #9, #16, #19, #20 | Significant extraction errors expected |
| **Very Hard** | #11, #12, #13, #15, #17 | Stress test for AI extraction limits |

---

## 📋 Recommended Test Set

For comprehensive testing, generate and test these 5 scenarios:

1. **Scanned Low Quality** (#1) - Tests basic OCR capability
2. **Mobile Photo with Glare** (#16) - Tests handling of imperfect captures
3. **Handwritten Invoice** (#3) - Tests handwriting recognition
4. **Faded Thermal Receipt** (#2) - Tests handling of low contrast
5. **Multi-language Invoice** (#12) - Tests regional language support

This gives you a realistic mix of challenges commonly faced in invoice processing systems.

## 🌧️ Additional Environmental Damage Scenarios

### 21. Water-Damaged Invoice (Rain/Spill)
```
A bus maintenance invoice damaged by water exposure, showing water stains creating brown
discoloration patterns, ink bleeding and running in wet sections making text blurry,
paper warped and wrinkled from drying after getting wet, some numbers completely washed
out and illegible, water droplet marks visible, invoice from roadside mechanic caught in
rain, realistic water damage with uneven staining across page, edges curled from moisture,
photographed after air-drying, dated January 2024, total amount section partially destroyed
by water, emergency repair bill for bus breakdown --ar 3:4
```

**Use Case**: Field workers submitting invoices that got wet during monsoon season or accidental spills.

**Expected Challenges**:
- Ink bleeding makes text fuzzy and hard to read
- Water stains create background noise
- Warped paper causes perspective distortion
- Critical sections (totals) often most damaged
- OCR confidence very low in affected areas

**AI Should**:
- Detect water damage patterns
- Apply deblurring algorithms
- Flag severely damaged sections
- Extract partial data from legible areas
- Recommend reissuing invoice from vendor

---

### 22. Wallet-Worn Receipt (Long-Term Storage)
```
A folded taxi or parking receipt carried in wallet for 3 weeks, showing extreme wear,
paper worn thin along fold lines creating visible grid pattern of creases, edges frayed
and torn, corners rounded from rubbing in pocket, thermal paper heavily faded with only
header and top section still readable, bottom half almost completely blank from fading,
receipt folded into quarters showing 4 distinct crease sections, slight dirt smudges,
sweat stains creating yellowish patches, text in fold creases completely illegible,
photographed unfolded and flattened on desk showing all wear patterns, realistic employee
expense receipt for reimbursement, from Uber/Ola cab service, amount barely visible --ar 2:3
```

**Use Case**: Employees submitting old receipts for reimbursement after carrying them in wallet/pocket for weeks.

**Expected Challenges**:
- Multiple intersecting fold lines create grid obstruction
- Extreme fading in thermal paper (time + body heat)
- Physical damage at creases (ink worn away)
- Dirt and sweat stains create background noise
- Torn edges missing data
- Receipt folded so long it won't lie flat (curved)

**AI Should**:
- Recognize fold pattern and reconstruct grid
- Handle severe fading with aggressive enhancement
- Interpolate missing data in creases
- Flag as "poor condition - verification needed"
- Suggest employee request new copy from vendor
- Extract date to check if resubmission of old expense
